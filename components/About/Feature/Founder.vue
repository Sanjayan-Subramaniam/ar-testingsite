        August Robotics was founded by Alex Wyatt.
        <br class="hidden xl:block" />Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia,
        Alex has always been fascinated and inspired by technology. <br /><br />

        After completing undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Law, Alex
        received the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship from Oxford University.
        There, he completed an MBA and an MPhil in Modern Chinese Studies.<br /><br />

        Alex had always wanted to apply his entrepreneurial efforts to globally
        connected, technology-oriented and purpose-driven projects. In 2006, he
        co-founded Climate Bridge, an international clean energy and carbon
        trading company. By the time he exited in 2013, the company had grown
        its portfolio to 200+ clean energy projects, comprising more than 7GW of
        power and US$2.5 billion total asset value. <br /><br />

        Hungry for an even bigger adventure, in 2017, Alex founded August
        Robotics with the mission to automate dirty, dangerous and dull jobs
        across the economy. Alexâ€™s role quickly pivoted from tinkering with
        robots to leading a global team across five offices, while maintaining
        an unwavering mission to improve businesses through technological
        innovation.
