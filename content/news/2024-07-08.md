_Meise, Belgium – August Robotics, the leading Exhibition floor marking solution provider in Europe was proud to attend the Febelux Connection Day_

## Magical Beginnings

Our European team had the pleasure of meeting and greeting key personnel from across the thriving Benelux region. The event was set in the gardens of the historic Bouchout Castle, providing the perfect backdrop for a fun day of mingling and connecting.<br/><br/>

The Benelux region (comprising Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) has a rich culture and strong history of economic and socio-political cooperation. This inspires a diverse range of events from large cultural fairs, city-wide art and fair exhibitions to large conferences on complex topics such as advancing Climate change and Human rights.<br/><br/>

With our team’s local knowledge and ability to support French, Dutch and German speakers we’re in a strong position to help Benelux venues benefit from automated floor marking and its associated optimisations.

## Febelux

Febelux stands for "Fairs and Exhibitions in Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands." and serves as a collective voice and support network for companies and professionals involved in organizing, hosting, and supporting events, exhibitions, and trade fairs across these three countries. The association aims to promote the interests of the industry, provide networking opportunities, and offer educational resources to its members.<br/><br/>

Joining Febelux has provided August Robotics with a valuable channel to learn about the challenges facing members, as well as to promote our renowned floor marking services. The strong focus on cultural events also offers opportunities to mark shows with unique layouts and challenging build times.<br/><br/>

Our membership also granted us a sneak-peak behind the scenes of Febelux’s plans for the year to come. In another nice gesture, Febelux made special mention of August Robotics as a leading Exhibition technology provider and introduced our team to leading venues in the region.<br/><br/>

## Keeping it Local

A key objective for our team was to understand the key challenges facing large GSCs (general service contractors) and how we might solve them with automation. One rapidly emerging trend was larger shows opting for more extravagant and difficult layouts.<br/><br/>

These layout are highly technical and in some cases cannot be feasibly marked with traditional methods. Lionel’s flexible marking technology is of course extremely well-suited to this use case and will be a key message in our value proposition.<br/><br/>

## New Oppportunities

Perhaps the greatest outcome of the event was connecting with partners who understand and empathise with our mission. We’re happy to reveal that we’ve been offered several new trial offers and marketing collaboration opportunities to promote Lionel across the continental USA. We can’t reveal too much more but we’re expecting our reach and awareness to grow considerably as a result.<br/><br/>

The ESCA summer conference was a fantastic event and gave our team a much deeper understanding of the people, ideas and culture that shape the North American exhibitions industry.
