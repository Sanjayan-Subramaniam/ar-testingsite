Clear blue skies and stunning scenery greeted our team as they participated in the renowned ESCA Summer Conference. Spanning 3 days, the conference aimed to connect leading North American contractors to discuss industry trends and the year to come.<br/><br/>

This year’s conference was held in the palatial Omni Homestead Resort at the base of the Allegheny Mountain range. With a diverse event program including numerous talks and workshops, horse-back riding, axe-throwing and a highly competitive golf tournament, the conference was a fun and informative affair for everyone involved.<br/><br/>

## Joining the Club

ESCA is the leading trade association for specialist contractors in the North American Exhibition industry. With 170 members across the world, the association is helping advance the industry and create networks for knowledge sharing.<br/><br/>

The Summer conference is ESCA’s flagship event and attracts key decision makers and influencers across the industry. As with the UFI congress events, this conference has become a key relationship-building and promotional event for the North American events industry.

## Fancy Shows Need Fancy Tech

A key objective for our team was to understand the key challenges facing large GSCs (general service contractors) and how we might solve them with automation. One rapidly emerging trend was larger shows opting for more extravagant and difficult layouts.<br/><br/>

These layout are highly technical and in some cases cannot be feasibly marked with traditional methods. Lionel’s flexible marking technology is of course extremely well-suited to this use case and will be a key message in our value proposition.<br/><br/>

## New Oppportunities

Perhaps the greatest outcome of the event was connecting with partners who understand and empathise with our mission. We’re happy to reveal that we’ve been offered several new trial offers and marketing collaboration opportunities to promote Lionel across the continental USA. We can’t reveal too much more but we’re expecting our reach and awareness to grow considerably as a result.<br/><br/>

The ESCA summer conference was a fantastic event and gave our team a much deeper understanding of the people, ideas and culture that shape the North American exhibitions industry.
