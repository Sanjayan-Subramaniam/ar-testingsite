_Hong Kong, China – August Robotics, the leading Floor Marking solution provider, announced that they have delivered more than 500,000+ marks for Exhibition customers all over the world_

## A Momentous Milestone for Exhibition Floor Marking

August Robotics is proud to announce a cumulative total of over 500,000+ marks created for Exhibition customers all over the world!<br/><br/>

This momentous milestone was reached in April 2024 while marking in Leipzig, Germany - which is where our floor marking journey first began<br/><br/>

The volume of marks being painted has grown significantly in recent months due to the onboarding of several large customers and a sizable increase in mark volume per show. As a point of reference, more than 17% of the total marks we’ve ever marked were created in just Q1 2024!<br/><br/>

## The Journey to 500k+

The story behind our marks closely follows the progress of Lionel’s product and technological improvements<br/><br/>

Initially we only offered booth corners, with an Engineer needing to manually mark more complicated marks such as booth labels<br/><br/>

The mechanism for creating marks for the first generation of Lionel was simple and reliable - a prudent approach to introducing the concept of automated floor marking to a new market<br/><br/>

## Stamping Our Way to Approval

This first and second generation of Lionel used a stamp mechanism to create marks. It was efficient and allowed us to prove the concept of automated floor marking.<br/><br/>

To improve marking volume we quickly iterated onto versions of Lionel with greater range and sensor technology. These helped us manage bigger halls and to utilise more advanced features such as ‘fleet server’ - the ability for multiple Lionels to work together.<br/><br/><br/><br/>

## A Pen-sive Short-term Solution

To meet customer demands for a greater variety of marks, we then released a version of Lionel with a ‘pen’ marking mechanism. The robot used a nylon pen that would physically paint the marks on the floor. This mechanism was accurate but the added friction and mechanical stress from painting increased the risk of failure modes. <br/><br/>

Given we were aiming to ensure continuous, reliable operation for hours on end, this was not a suitable long-term solution. <br/><br/><br/><br/>

## Paint Spray Leading the Way

After an extensive round of internal development, the team finally settled on the solution we still use to this day - a paint-spraying mechanism. This mechanism allows Lionel to deliver accurate and high resolution custom marks, while keeping mechanical stress to a minimum. <br/><br/>

The Mechanism sprays paint in a thin line that allows great mark resolution and accuracy within 3mm. It also allows much greater levels of flexibility and modularity, with less consumable parts and allowing fast replacement of paint colors or types if needed. <br/><br/><br/><br/>

Our product and engineering teams are constantly innovating to ensure Lionel delivers the world’s most reliable, accurate and flexible floor marking experience. We’ve got some really exciting tech in our R&D testing pipeline that we’re excited to bring to market…expect an announcement very soon!<br/><br/>

Congrats again to our incredible team and their tireless efforts to get us this far - we’re expecting more thrills and challenges ahead as we aim to ‘drop a tonne’ (reach the 1 Million marks milestone)!<br/><br/>
