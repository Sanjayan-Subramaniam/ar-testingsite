August Robotics is happy to announce we’ll be marking the floor layout for IMEX America 2024. IMEX is the largest MICE centric show in the world, with more than 3000+ exhibitors and an expected audience of 20,000 international attendees.
<br/><br/>

IMEX is renowned for being the centre of excellence for MICE professionals and vendors, with a strong focus on professional education and best practices. As an enabler of advanced exhibition layouts, August Robotics is proud to provide a tangible showcase of the latest advancements in floor marking technology.<br/><br/>

This year’s show will be held at the Mandalay Bay convention center in Las Vegas - the fifth largest venue in North America. Set over 4 halls and 270,000 sqft, our US Lionel fleet and team are gearing up for a very busy day of marking.<br/><br/>

## Sneak-peak

Although floor marking is pivotal to the success of any show, it doesn’t get as much attention as the final exhibition. The IMEX organisers have allowed August Robotics to film our team and Lionel fleet as they mark the floors and collaborate with GES and other contractors bringing IMEX America 2024 to life.<br/><br/>

The footage will be featured in an exciting behind-the-scenes short-film to be featured on IMEX’s channels. We’re delighted to showcase our team and the amazing work they do - and hopefully grant show attendees a new appreciation for the importance of fast, accurate and reliable floor marking.<br/><br/>
